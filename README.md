### Features Left to Implement
- Interactive Map of Landmarks. Embed a Google Maps or Leaflet map with pins for each landmark. This helps users visualise locations and plan routes directly.
- Event Calendar Integration. Instead of static text, add a calendar widget or dynamic event feed. This allows users to see upcoming cultural events in a structured way.
- Image Lightbox / Gallery. Let users click food or landmark images to view them full screen. This improves mobile usability and makes visuals more engaging.
- Search or Filter Functionality. Add a search bar or filters (e.g., “food,” “history,” “wine”, "baths") so users can quickly find what interests them.
- Backend integration for the contact form to send submissions directly.  
- Testimonials or Local Tips Section. Short quotes or tips from locals/travellers add authenticity and make the site feel more personal.
- Performance Optimisation. Lazy‑loading images and compressing assets improve speed, especially for mobile users on the go.
- Multilingual Support Offering Hungarian and English versions broadens the audience and makes the site more useful for both locals and tourists.

## Manual Testing
